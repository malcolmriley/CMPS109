 * Graph class implementation. Uses matrix to track edges, with the
 * value stored in the matrix being the edge weight. A value less than
 * zero stored in the matrix is considered to be "disconnected", that is
 * to say, there is no edge connecting the relevant nodes.
 *
 * The graph may be set to be directed or undirected.
